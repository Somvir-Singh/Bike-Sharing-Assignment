## Introduction
</font>

### A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

### In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. Company want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market and the company wants to know:

>### Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
>### How well those variables describe the bike demands

## General Information
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.


A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

## Conclusions
a.	It has been ensured that error terms are approximately normally distributed. This is evident from the histogram. 
b.	Multicollinearity check was conducted. There was no multi collinearity as is evident from the VIF calculations and also from the heatmap.
c.	Linear relationship validation was made using CCPR plot and linearity was visible among the variables.
d.	Homoscedasticity check was done. No visible pattern was found among residual variables.
e.	R2 score of test data predictions: 0.69441
f.	R2 score of train data predictions: 0.70236
g.	Absolute difference between R2 scores of test and train dataset predictions: 0.00795
h.	Difference bw train and test model results is less than 5%. so it is generalized model with app 1% difference.
